# Flash Cards App

This is an app created to help me with language learning.
It supports storing a vocabulary of words in the target language and their English meanings.
It also displays a related picture through a photo API when possible.
It can also store example sentences for vocabulary words to provide context.

Practicing learned words through a method similar to flashcards is possible.
The app automatically selects a random word to practice from the visible words listed.
You can guess the word's meaning and then click/tap on it to reveal its meaning.
Then you can press on the 'wrong' or 'right' button depending on if you guessed right or wrong.
The app will automatically bring up a different flashcard after the guessing process.
