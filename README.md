# Flash Cards App

This is an app I created to help me with language learning.
It supports storing a vocabulary of words in the target language and their English meanings.
It also displays a related picture through a photo API when possible.
It also stores example sentences for vocabulary words to provide context. If no sentence is given, one is automatically generated using AI.

Practicing learned words through a method similar to flashcards is possible.
The app automatically selects a random word to practice from the visible words listed.
You can guess the word's meaning and then click/tap on it to reveal it.
Then you can press on the 'wrong' or 'right' button depending on if you guessed right or wrong.
The app will automatically bring up a different flashcard after the guessing process.

The application uses a simple authentication method for adding new words and editing or deleting existing ones.
The authentication password is entered into the textbox at the bottom and the "auth" button is clicked.
After that, one can add new words to the app by providing a new word along with its meaning and pressing the "add" button.
Use of the flashcards feature is still available without authentication.
